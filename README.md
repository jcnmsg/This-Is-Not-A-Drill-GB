# This Is Not A Drill: The Inside Job for the Game Boy
This game was made in a weekend for the Global Game Jam 2020 for which the theme was "Repair". The original entry can be found [here](https://globalgamejam.org/2020/games/not-drill-2). It follows the "Mi Casa es tu Casa" jam diversifier in which the game had to happen in the same universe as another game participating in the jam - that game was [This Is Not a Drill](https://globalgamejam.org/2020/games/not-drill-3).

## :video_game:	Gameplay
The gameplay is pretty straightforward: your station is under attack and cracks will appear around the rooms. You'll have to pickup the hammer, move to the room with the crack as fast as possible and press A to repair it. Your score is tracked on the bottom left of the screen.
## :hammer: Development
The game was developed in C using GBDK v2.95-3 so you'll need to download that if you intend to compile it yourself. The code is [r/programminghorror](https://www.reddit.com/r/programminghorror/) material but I'm publishing it anyway as part of a personal effort to archive some of my old projects. It's possible that the code here is unfinished but the build is definitely the final one.
